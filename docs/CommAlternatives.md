## Analysis of Alternatives

A document for teammates to review the Communication options available.

### Communication

Amidst the global pandemic situation that everyone has been put into, the option of meeting face-to-face to perform aspects of Scrum such as Daily Standups, Sprint Planning Meetings, etc. is out of the question as we are advised to social distance. As a result, we have to resort to online communication as a means to perform our meetings and/or discussions. 

_Main criteria_:

*   Accessibility and familiarity with service
*   Ease of communication

#### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Possibilities</span>



##### 1. Discord

_Pros_:



*   Every group member already has an account
*   Everyone is already familiar with the features/UI of the application
*   Supports video calls and screen-sharing; good for collaboration
*   Ability to know whether a call is ongoing or not

_Cons_:



*   Distractive

##### 2.  Zoom

_Pros_:

*   Not everyone requires an account
*   Call can be entered easily through a link
*   Support video calls and screen-sharing; good for collaboration

_Cons:_



*   The person creating the link is required to create an account
*   Time limit on meetings, for non paid accounts
*   Difficult to determine if there is an ongoing call 

##### 3. Whatsapp

_Pros:_

*   Ability to reply at any moment they find some spare time.
*   Does not require everyone to be online at once

_Cons:_



*   Distractive



While all three options remain viable solutions, practically Discord and Whatsapp will be more effective, due to frequent use by the team members.

Therefore, we have decided to communicate through Discord and Whatsapp as our form of communication throughout the entirety of this process. Discord will be used to achieve features of Scrum such as Sprint Planning Meetings and Sprint Reviews via video calling as these require real-time communication amongst teammates. Furthermore, Whatsapp will be utilized to perform Daily Standups as not everyone will be free to meet up for video calls due to busy schedules and Whatsapp allows us to inform each other of our progress at any spare time we can find in our day.
