## 1.0. Project Overview

This document outlines the plan to be followed in the design and development of the student task tracking system proposed by the client. 


### 1.1. Project Summary:

The client requires an application for teachers to mark group work fairly by monitoring time, work done and student progress. The application is required to be accessible to the client, irrespective of the device. It will need to provide tools for the teacher to create different groups/projects and monitor data, with helpful graphical representation. (Charts, Graphs) .

Further, it must also provide an intuitive interface for the students to input data, so that proper records are maintained. 


### 1.2. Vision statement

We will create a student task/time tracking system for teachers who need to mark group work fairly to monitor their students’ progress online. Unlike most other products, our product uses a simplistic, intuitive user interface for optimal user experience.


## 2.0. Process Model


### 2.1. Basis: Scrum

The basis for the team’s process model is scrum. While the basic principles of scrum are followed, certain modifications have been made taking into account the nature of the project, context within which the project is worked on, team member requests. 

A product owner and scrum master have been chosen from within the team and are presented in section 3.2 of this document.

**The core aspects of scrum will be followed.**



1. Work will be done in sprints, with a sprint planning meeting at the start of the sprint and a sprint retrospective and a prod	uct review, at the end of it
2. A sprint backlog and a product backlog is maintained, with the usual workflow of moving items from the sprint backlog to the product backlog at the start of each sprint at the sprint planning meeting
3. Requirements are gauged in the form of user stories, as is followed by most agile practices, allowing the developer to think of the software from the perspective of a client and 
4. Backlog items/user stories will be under constant review, and will be refined as needed, as the project grows.
5. At the end of each sprint, it is sought to provide the client with a working iteration of the product. 
6. Team members will help each other in development and will share knowledge and will not be limited to a certain domain of work and instead will focus on working together as a team.
7. Frequent interaction with the client is encouraged and the team will not be hesitant to contact the client to clarify doubts.


#### 2.1.1. Backlog Management

Our backlogs will be managed through Trello. This allows the members to keep track of the remaining backlog items, and distinguish the required tasks for the current sprint. It also helps in efficiently checking progress including, seeing what backlog items have been completed.

This method has been tried and tested in previous sprints.

#### 2.1.2. Scrum Ceremonies/Procedure

**Sprint Planning** 

Sprint planning will be done on the first Monday of each sprint, via Whatsapp and Discord. (Refer the document on Communication alternatives, where the reason for the use of these platforms is examined). It will involve refining user stories, assigning tasks, defining roles that the team will follow, during the sprint.

Further, there will be an attempt to estimate how long a given user story takes to complete, to be used as a gauge when analysing progress (See Burndown charts under section 2.1.4)

The duration of the sprint is out of the team’s control and all sprints are longer than a week. The sprint planning session of the second week is referred to as the **Sprint review**, for the purposes of this project. 

It will be a mix of a sprint planning session and a retrospective, held to ensure that the team is on the right track.

**Daily Scrum meetings** 

These meetings will be a short session where each member can provide an update on their progress, to the team.This can be done informally via Whatsapp or Discord. As is explained in Section 3.1, these two platforms are the main mode of communication between different team members. 

This has been changed to once every three days, as the team members are students who have a significant workload and might be unable to find time to focus on this project on a daily basis. However, it is expected that quantifiable progress will be made by each team member within three days.

**Sprint Retrospective**

This will be done on the second Friday of each sprint, during our team’s allocated tutorial session. The Sprint retrospective will focus on the team looking back at the progress done during that specific sprint and deciding if there is room for improvement, as well as for open discussion of what the team thinks of the project so far. This will allow for reflection and subsequent improvement.

**Product Review**

Product Review will involve showing the client the application after the sprint, where the client gets to formally comment on the product. As is explained in section 2.1, it is a main objective of the team to<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> deliver a working iteration of the product</span>, for the client, as this sprint review. 


#### 2.1.3. Task Allocation

We will allocate tasks from our sprint backlog _during the Sprint planning meeting_, at the beginning of each sprint, but tasks will not be fixed; team members have the freedom to cooperate on certain tasks.

Once the tasks are allocated, in Trello, the names are assigned at the bottom of the tasks they are assigned to indicate that they are the ones responsible for its completion.

Furthermore, the team mates who are responsible for a particular type of task, can ensure that help is provided to members. (These responsibilities with regard to development,are presented in section 3.3)


### 2.1.4. Progress Tracking

The backlog management tool Trello is very helpful in tracking progress. Further, GitLab commits can be used to the flow of the progress, in terms of development. 




By using different cards, the items that have been completed, as well as the items that remain, can be easily viewed. Further, Tasks done in different sprints can be separated.

**Burndown charts**

Further, burndown charts will be drawn each sprint, to keep track of the velocity, and see if it’s meeting the required standard.

Tasks left will be plotted against time. It will be compared against a linear estimation, decided on, at the start of each sprint, in the sprint planning session. This will be recorded in the documentation after each sprint.


### 2.1.5. Time Tracking

Time tracking was initially planned to be done on Trello, itself, with a separate card for each team member, within which each person will type in their timelogs.

While this is helpful, as all of the tracking data is in one place, it does not lend itself well to comparison. Therefore, time tracking data is recorded separately on a spreadsheet.

The link to spreadsheet is as follows.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aQ9n-EtHrXIslnam6zDI9bTUnDokdoGX8hvfRoHE6IQ/edit#gid=75160878](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aQ9n-EtHrXIslnam6zDI9bTUnDokdoGX8hvfRoHE6IQ/edit#gid=75160878)

Each member shall have his own table, where he will type in his time-logs, from which the duration can be calculated. 


### 2.1.6. The Scheduled Times for the Scrum Ceremonies

This allocated time for each scrum ceremony is summarized here.

## 3.0. Team members and roles

The team is composed of 5 people, each of whom will be assigned different roles and responsibilities, with regard to the process of developing the application.


### 3.1. Communication

The different alternatives with regard to how communication can be managed, is explored in detail, in the document for the Analysis of Communication Alternatives.

Ultimately, it was decided that the main form of communication would be through Whatsapp and Discord. 

All the team members would be privy to the others’ email addresses, for the purposes of collaboration on google docs as well as to communicate, should the other methods of communication fail.

## 4.0. Development Workflow


### 4.1. Version Control

Development will be done using Git for version control. A short discussion on this is made in the analysis of alternatives documents, even though the choice of VCS is out of the team’s control.


### 4.2. Git Branching Model

The team has decided to use a git branching model with a master branch and a develop branch mainly. The master branch will contain the main codebase, which is the product that will be deployed to the client. The develop branch is the main development branch, on which all members will commit. 

Different branches will be made for different functionalities, if they involve rather large changes to the codebase at large. 






![alt_text](images/image2.png "illustration of git branching model")


                                          


### 4.3. Merging Policy

All major changes to the codebase, from one branch to another are required to be submitted via Merge Request. This involves



1. All merges to the master branch
2. Merges from a feature branch to the develop branch
3. Merges from any hotfix branch: Used for bug fixes.

Merge requests require a minimum of 1 approvals to be approved for merge, as a general rule of thumb. 

However, trivial merges, including resolving merge conflicts, can be done without Merge requests.


### 4.4. Code quality

The code is expected to adhere to a reasonable standard of quality, and the team will review each other’s work constructively and can offer suggestions and help each other on tasks.


### 5.0. Definition of Done

For a task to be considered done, 



*   It needs to pass all test cases devised for the tasks
*   Needs to be approved by a Merge Request (preferably by a teammate who is responsible for the relevant backlog items)

While the above is the definition of done, in general, we expect the following criteria to be met, to consider a particular task as done.
